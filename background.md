For a while now, we've been advocating ES6 as we've become increasingly
convinced that it helps reduce cognitive load for JavaScript developers, thus
making code both more legible and modular.

However, even modern browsers don't fully
[support](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) all the new features yet,
so getting started can be a bit daunting: We need a preprocessor
("[transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler)") to
translate ES6 into the more universally supported ES5 and also to combine
individual source-code modules into a single bundle. Unfortunately, getting this
right is often tricky â€” so much so that a commonly encountered sentiment is
"I'd like to use ES6, but haven't set up a transpiler yet".

Similarly, CSS preprocessors like Sass can provide the same benefits for the
styling side of web development, but can also be a hassle to set up.

In order to simplify the process, faucet takes care of all the minutiae,
providing the underlying infrastructure and reducing configuration to the bare
minimum required. With all that out of the way, we can focus on actually writing
the code. Thus we can easily recommend it to friends and colleagues and get them
started in less than a minute.

for internal applications by both companies.
